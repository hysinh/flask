    <h2>{{ page_title }}</h2>
    <p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

                <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
                <p>Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King,[1] was the son of Thráin II, the
                    older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known
                    for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug
                    and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.</p>
